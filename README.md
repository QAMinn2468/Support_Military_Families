# Support_Military_Families
A website to prractice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills

I have been working as a Software Test Engineer for over 2 years now and my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills had been rarely used in that time.
With the fresh new year I was inspired to create this webpage.  In addition A11y and responsiveness were considered.

This project is close to my heart as I am a 20 year military spouse.  It wasn't until my spouse retired from the military 
that I realized the depth and breadth of my service and that of our children.  

For support as a military spouse in tech: https://www.facebook.com/MilSpouseCoders/

For support as a woman in tech: https://www.facebook.com/groups/techladies

There are many other groups out there, good luck!
